# Robo-Flow

The goal of Robo-Flow is not just to build an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but to build an AGI capable of entering a creative flow state to help humans build and create.

## The Core Concept: A Desktop Hypervisor

The first vision for Robo-Flow is to act as an operating system, but not in the traditional sense. It's more of a "desktop hypervisor". It exists as a layer of software that can observe and interact with a standard computer operating system.

Robo-Flow perceives the world by capturing the screen's outputâ€”the same image a human user would see. It then analyzes this visual data to understand the state of the system. The transition from a state A to a state B is achieved by Robo-Flow intelligently interacting with the graphical user interface, just as a human would.

## The Operating Domain: Understanding the Screen

For Robo-Flow to operate effectively, it must first understand its domain. In this case, the domain is the graphical user interface of an operating system.

The primary task for Robo-Flow is to analyze the screen and identify all the elements it can directly operate on. This includes:

*   **GUI Elements:** Buttons, text fields, menus, sliders, and other widgets.
*   **APIs:** Where possible, Robo-Flow could detect if an application exposes an API that allows for more direct control than simple UI interaction.

By building a comprehensive model of the available actions on the screen, Robo-Flow can begin to plan and execute tasks.

## Robo-Flow x Human Interaction

How does Robo-Flow interact with humans?

The interaction is centered around a shared understanding of the desired state. A human user has a goal in mind (State B), and they need to communicate this to Robo-Flow.

Robo-Flow, with its understanding of the screen (State A), can then work autonomously to perform the sequence of UI interactions needed to reach State B. The "flow state" is achieved when Robo-Flow can seamlessly understand the user's intent and translate it into actions, creating a powerful human-machine creative partnership.

## Proposed Tech Stack

To build the initial version of Robo-Flow as a desktop hypervisor, the following technologies could be a good starting point:

*   **Core Logic:** Python is an excellent choice due to its extensive libraries for the tasks required.
*   **Screen Capture:** Libraries like `mss` or `PyAutoGUI` can provide fast and efficient screen capturing.
*   **Computer Vision & Element Detection:** OpenCV is the standard for many computer vision tasks. We can use it for template matching to find simple icons or buttons. For more advanced element detection, a custom-trained machine learning model (using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch) could be trained to recognize a wide variety of GUI elements (buttons, text boxes, dropdowns, etc.).
*   **System Control:** `PyAutoGUI` can be used to control the mouse and keyboard to perform clicks, typing, and other interactions with the GUI elements identified by the computer vision component.
*   **Orchestration:** A state machine library or a simple event-driven architecture could be used to manage the flow of capturing, analyzing, and acting.
