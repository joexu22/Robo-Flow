# Robo-Flow
What is the point of just building AGI, What you want to build is an AGI who is able to get into a creative flow state to help humans build and create

## Let There Be Light
The first step is vision

rather - for the sake of building robo-flow, it is a operating system

robo-flow is a operating system able to interface with mechanical hardware but exist independantly as a function... as software

there is a state A and state B and transition function between A to B (modern day computer archetecture of Aug 2025, is the hardware, i guess disk/memory - most of the current day "OS"/brain is mostly on GPUs)

robo-flow acts as the software "operating system" to get from state A to state B


## Robo-Flow X Human Interaction

how does robo-flow interact with humans?

first is how does Robo-Flow have internal representation... how does it sense things... this is answered by the "Let There Be Light" section

it is a state... a state machine representation of the set that all A&Bs are in

Typically humans have a desired B state that they want A state to be converted into

The go of Robo-Flow X Human Interaction is so that Robo-Flow understands what the desired B state of the Human it is interacting with

Then Robo-Flow will through this action of understanding the human's desired B state, process in parallel and autonomously as a "Robo" the way to change state A to state B

Flow state can be maximized by trying to integrate the Human as best it can into the flow - a shared creative process to shape what B state will look like
